A python module for simulation-based optimization.

## Project Features

This project is currently under development and in a very experimental state. The goal is to provide a simulation-based optimization framework. The functionality builds on the tools from the following libraries.

 - Metamodelling features from the [Surrogate Modeling Toolbox](https://github.com/SMTorg/smt).
 - Optimization tools from [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)

## Getting Started

Install using 

```
pip install git+https://github.com/hbrs-cse/treeopt.git
```

and check out the examples.

The project's documentation contains a section to help you
[get started](https://TREEOPT.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) as a developer or
user of the library. Read the [Contribution Guide](https://TREEOPT.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/contributing.html) if you would like to contribute to the project.
